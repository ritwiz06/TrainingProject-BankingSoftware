## Bank System Program in C++

The program provided is a simple bank system implemented in C++. It allows users to perform basic banking operations. Let's break down its features and functionality:

### Classes and Objects

The program uses the concept of classes to define the `Bank` class, which represents the bank system.
Objects of the `Bank` class are created to perform operations on the bank system.

### User Input and Output

The program utilizes input and output streams (`cin` and `cout`) to interact with the user.
It prompts the user for input and displays output accordingly.

### Control Flow

Control flow statements such as `if`, `else if`, `else`, `for`, and `switch` are used to control the execution of code based on different conditions.
The program presents a menu-based interface to the user, allowing them to choose various options.

### Arrays and Strings

The program employs arrays and strings to store customer information such as names, account numbers, IDs, addresses, and balances.
A struct named `customer` is used to encapsulate the customer details.

### Functions

The program defines several functions to perform specific tasks:
- `newData()`: Creates a new customer account by accepting input for name, ID, address, contact, and initial balance.
- `show()`: Displays the details of all customer accounts that have been created.
- `update()`: Allows the user to update the details of an existing customer account.
- `search()`: Enables the user to search for a specific customer account by ID or account number.
- `transactions()`: Facilitates depositing and withdrawing money from a customer account.
- `del()`: Deletes a customer account.

### Libraries

The program includes the following libraries:
- `iostream`: For basic input/output operations.
- `conio.h`: For console input/output operations, such as reading a single character from the console.
- `windows.h`: For console manipulation, such as clearing the screen and pausing execution.

It's important to note that the program doesn't utilize file handling to save customer or login details persistently. Additionally, exception handling is not implemented to handle potential errors or exceptional conditions. The program assumes that user inputs and operations will be valid.

Overall, the program provides a simple interface for managing customer accounts in a bank system, allowing users to create accounts, view account details, update information, perform transactions, and delete accounts.
